## Welcome to My GitHub Page

Hi, my name is Xin Bi, and I am a Junior at The Pennsylvania State University.<br/>Looking for an internship over Summer 2020.<br/><br/><img align="right"  width="200" height="275" src="https://xinbi99.github.io/headshot.png">
I am double majoring in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, with a minor in Economics, averaging at about 20 credit hours per week. With my rigorous academic schedule, I have a wealth of technical skills that can guarantee success in any workplace that is relevant to my majors. <br/><br/>
I have independently completed projects such as a device driver that interfaces between a virtual application and virtualized hardware devices, and a cipher lock implemented on a complex programmable logic device. <br/><br/>
I have also done a tremendous amount of intrapersonal work such as organizing large live events for my schoolâ€™s Chinese student association and handling the day to day work of an intern at a startup company.

Current GPA: 3.85/4.00
